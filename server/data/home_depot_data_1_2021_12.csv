Large Size Plumbing Vent Repair for 4 in. Lead Flashing (3 in. Vents),"In many areas of the United States plumbing vents are sealed with lead. Unfortunately, squirrels like to gnaw on the lead and tear it open, potentially causing roof leaks. Over time, these leaks can cause significant damage. In addition plumbing vents are a major entry point for frogs, rats and other animals to enter into toilets. In the past the only way to repair this was to call a contractor, have them pull shingles, replace the lead and put a screen on the repaired vent. A repair that requires shingle removal rarely looks good potentially exposes damage and is expensive. Critter Quitter offers a cost effective and attractive solution to this problem. A home owner can repair their damaged plumbing vents without having to remove shingles or call a professional. Simply cut the unit to match your roof pitch, slide the unit onto the damaged vent and secure with 4 stainless steel screws (provided). The internal component will direct rain water into the vent keeping the damaged portion dry and keep animals out of plumbing. The unit is easily removed if plumbing vent access is required.",Critter Quitter,30,USD

"Whole House Water Filter System w/ 20 x 4.5 Sediment, Carbon Block, and Lead Reducing Filters and 3/4 Push-Fit Hoses","The WGB32B-PB whole house filtration system is an ideal ""point of entry"" filtration system for cleaning up well water. Unlike ""point of use"" systems (like RO systems) that are installed to supply water to a specific faucet, the WGB32B-PB filters your water from the source. This means water from every output in your home will have passed through the three filtration stages of the WGB32B-PB. Used as the first stage of defense on the system, the stage 1 housing holds a 5-micron high-capacity polypropylene sediment filter. This filter removes dirt and other various larger sized particles from the water that can clog the following filters. The second stage of the WGB32B-PB houses a 5-micron CTO coconut shell carbon block filter. Block carbon is more effective than other forms of carbon in that it is finely ground up carbon packed into a solidified block. This means they have a higher density than other types of carbon filters and are therefore more effective in removing their targeted contaminants. The carbon block filter knocks out bad tastes and odors, removes over 90% of chlorine from the water and is highly effective on organic chemicals (VOCs) like pesticides, herbicides and industrial chemicals. The third stage of the WGB32B-PB houses an iron and lead reducing filter. The FCRC25B iron and lead reducing filter is only included with the WGB32B-PB, as it is not needed for most municipal water supplies that the WGB32B targets.",ISPRING,594.83,USD
